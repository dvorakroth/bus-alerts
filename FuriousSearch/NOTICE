the code in this directory is all based on Fuse JS
https://github.com/krisk/Fuse

which was licensed under the apache 2 license (included here in the file named
 LICENSE.Apache2.txt because i think i'm obligated to include it? idk)

however since it is a derivative work (i greatly simplified the code, and added
type annotations), then (i think?) i'm allowed to release it under whatever
license i want(?) -- and i chose to release this entire project pretty much,
into the public domain

for more details about that, see the service-alerts project's licensing notes
